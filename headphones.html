        <h1 align="center">Headphone Types and Drivers</h1>
        <p>There are many types of headphones in existence, however the main types are in ear, on ear, and over ear.<br><br>
          In ears, or in ear monitors, are what people think of when they hear "earbud." They usually have a tip, silicone or foam, which inserts into the ear.
          There are also earphones, which are what Apple AirPods are like. They have no tip, and are molded plastic or metal.
          In ear headphones are usually a great choice when you need the best passive sound isolation, as they block the ear canal, effectively blocking other noises from reaching your ear drums.
          They are also great for on the go, since they are low profile and portable due to their small size. <br><br>
          On ear headphones are exactly that; they are headphones that rest on your ears. They usually have a foam, velour, or leather pad, and are commonly used for portable headphones as well.
          A popular example of an on ear headphone would be the Beats Solos. They are ususally pretty small and lightweight, and often are a good portable choice.
          Some people may find them uncomfortable, but others find them fine. In my opinion, they are the least comfortable of the 3 main types.<br><br>
          Lastly is over ear headphones, which are named such because the pads go all the way around your ears. I find these to be the more comfortable between over and on ears, and they are usually my favorite types of headphones for sitting and listening to music or gaming.
          There are many portable versions of over ears, but they tend to be a little bit less convenient, as they are usually larger and harder to store away when not in use, as well as looking rather bulky.
          However, they also usually have a lot to offer, as their larger size allows for larger drivers, which means they can often have more bass than other headphone types, and there is a lot more room for acoustic tuning.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">Open and Closed Back</h2>
        <p>Besides shape, there is also the decision to make between open, closed, and semi-closed back headphones. They all have strengths and weaknesses, and are completely subjective choices.<br><br>
          Open back headphones quite literally have an open back, usually with a grill to protect the driver of the headphone. They tend to have the widest soundstages along with offering good imaging. This makes them great for analytical listening, where you want to feel immersed in the audio.
          However, they have a main drawback, which is the fact that they have no noise isolation. You can hear anything and everything going on around you.
          Some people enjoy this, as they might have kids or a pet they need to pay attention to, but in a noisy environment, this can be a massive pain.<br><br>
          Closed backs are my personal preference, as they offer the best isolation from outside noise. They also tend to offer more bass in the headphone, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference.
          Closed headphones are also really useful for professional audio events for monitoring, because of the isolation. Some of the most popular professional audio headphones are closed back, and are legendary in their own respect.<br><br>
          Lastly are semi-open back headphones. They offer a little of both worlds. They tend to have better soundstages than closed headphones, smaller soundstages than open, but offer some noise isolation.
          There are a lot less options for semi-open back headphones, as they are very niche, but some are famous for recrding studios, such as offerings from AKG.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">Driver Types</h2>
        <p>There are a few main types of drivers. These include dynamic drivers, balanced armatures, planar magnetic, and electrostatic.<br><br>
          Dynamic drivers are the most common, and are cones made of metal, paper, or plastic that use a magnet on one side to produce sound.<br><br>
          Balanced armatures are exclusively used in IEMs, and are a small dynamic driver in a housing, making them able to be placed in any way inside the shell of the IEM without affecting sound quality.<br><br>
          Planar magnetic headphones are rarer, and use a sheet of metal with magnets on both sides to create sound. They often need more power and also have a unique sound to them.<br><br>
          Electrostatic headphones, or earspeakers, are extremely unique and expensive. They work in a fairly similar way to planars, but take MUCH more power.
