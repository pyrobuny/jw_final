      <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Warnon. although I also often go online by the name pyrobunny.<br><br>
        I'm a college student very near to graduation from Clarkson University studying Business Intelligence and Data Analytics with a minor in Project Management.
        I'm involved in a lot of media clubs on campus, such as being the General Manager of WTSC 91.1FM The Source, as well as a committee chair for the Clarkson Union Board.
        Evidently, I love music and audio, and such have gotten myself into the audiophile hobby. I may not be the most experienced person when it comes to audio, but I have a passion to learn and experience more.
        I also enjoy video games, and have even founded an esports organization called Lost Art Gaming. I competed in games such as Call of Duty, Ironsight, and Overwatch, but have moved more into a management and coaching role.
        I've worked on many programming projects, and am familiar with languages such as Python, C++, Java and JavaFX, SQL, HTML/CSS and a small amount of Javascript.<br><br>
        But of course, this is an audio focused site. I've always loved music, having been a clarinetist as a youth, as well as awlways enjoying listening to music.
        As I got older, I became more and more interested in pursuing the extremity of what music can be, which led me to getting into the audiophile world.
        I have a humble collection in comparison to what exists out there, with my main listening setup costing less than $2000 in total between my DAC, headphone amplifier, main headphones, speaker amplifier, and speakers.
        However, I am always interested in trying new things, and have slowly built up a collection of more and more equipment that I love.
        All of the headphones shown on the homepage belong to me, however that is not my desk. My desk is MUCH messier, and not nearly as good looking.<br><br>
        If you would like to reach out to me, please contact me at jonathan.warnon@gmail.com or fill out the form below.<br>
