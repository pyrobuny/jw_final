      <p>Welcome to the awesome world of audio, where people look crazy and insane amounts of money are spent. Where the numbers seem made up, and not many people really know what's going on.
        It's a lovely hobby to get into, but also insanely easy to fall down the rabbit hole, and your wallet empties at terrifying speeds. Of course, it's really all about the music, right? RIGHT?<br><br>
        According to the online Oxford dictionary, an audiophile is "a hi-fi enthusiast." A short, simple, and to-the-point description of a very not short, simple, and to-the-point hobby.
        Wikipedia says a little more about the hobby, saying "An audiophile is a person who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. An audiophile seeks to reproduce the sound of a live musical performance, typically in a room with good acoustics."<br>
        It of course then goes on to say "It is widely agreed that reaching this goal is very difficult and that even the best-regarded recording and playback systems rarely, if ever, achieve it."<br><br>
        Although it isn't wrong, it hurts a little to admit. But hey, that's why it's all about finding what's right for you, no matter how much money you have to spend to find it!

          <p>Everything great starts from humble beginnings. Here's a look at simple, inexpensive, entry-level Hi-Fi gear to get your collection kickstarted.</p></div>

          <center><h3>Chi-Fi</h3></center>
          <p>It may not be the most loved, but the "Chi-Fi" scene is growing constantly, and is becoming a force to be reckoned with. Chinese Hi-Fi (Chi-Fi for short) is becoming mainstream, and it's here to stay.</p></div>
        <div class="text3">
          <center><h3>Mid-Fi</h3></center>
          <p>As your collection grows, you'll want to try new things and experience different headphones. Mid-Fi is this stage of exploration into more expensive cans, different driver types, and is where you'll want to start admitting you have a problem.</p></div>
        <div class="text4">
          <center><h3>End Game</h3></center>
          <p>This is it, ladies and gentlemen. The End Game. Not for the faint of heart, the headphones that are truly end game have price tags that will shock you, but design and quality to match.</p></div>
