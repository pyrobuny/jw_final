        <h1 align="center">DACs and Amplifiers</h1>
        <h2 align="center">DACs</h2>
        <p>A DAC, or Digital to Analog Converter, is the component in your device that creates sound from a digital file.
          DACs are found in any device that has a headphone jack, like a phone or laptop, but can also be purchased separately for those seeking the best possible sound quality.
          The main point of getting a more expensive DAC is file compatibility and bitrate. File compatibility refers to what file types your DAC can easily decode.
          For example, most music is found in MP3, but that is a lossy file type, as it is compressed. There are file types like WAV and FLAC that are lossless, and some are also compressed.
          These files are usually much larger, as they need to store more data. Bitrate refers to packet size and send frequency, and the higher you go, the higher quality is, theoretically.
          Of course, this is also limited to what the human ear and brain can detect, so it is not quite a perfect science.<br><br>
          Most audiophiles will get a separate DAC from their listening devie to isolate the DAC, meaning it has the lowest chance of interference from other devices.
          This can also help with grounding issues or if you hear too much extra noise when listening on a device.
          DACs can be cheap, under $20, even, or well above tens of thousands of dollars. There is little scientific evidence we can hear the difference between DAC chips, but the cost increases as the quality of other components increases, as well as the reduction of signal noise.<br><br>
          </p>
        <h2 align="center">Amplifiers</h2>
        <p>Amplifiers, on the other hand, have a much more noticeable effect on sound. The amplifier is what adds volume to the analog signal created by a DAC so that it is at an audible level.
          The main purpose, as mentioned, is to provide volume to headphones. In a lot of cases, the sensitivity of a headphone driver may be low, or they may have a higher impedance and require more juice to get them going.
          This is why amplifiers exist. For very power hungry headphones, you need to give them that power and those high power amplifiers can cost a lot of money.<br><br>
          However, the real reason for cost of an amplifier is how much it colors sound. Solid state amplifiers are known to be clean, and only add volume, with no change to quality or tone.
          However, tube amplifiers exist, and tubes can affect how sound is interpreted. They can change how much impact is in notes, how much bass or treble there is, and plenty more.
          Because of this, tube amplifiers can be used by enthusiasts who chase a specific sound, and tubes will be swapped and tested until those enthusiasts find the exact tonal qualities they want.
          These amplifiers can cost hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of dollars, although a good, tone-perfect amplifier can be had for less than $100.
